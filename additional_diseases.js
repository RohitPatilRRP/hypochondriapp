S bovis is mostly transmitted by Bulinus freshwater snail species. It is one of nine haematobium group species and exists in the same geographical areas as Schistosoma haematobium, with which it can hybridise. S. bovis-S. haematobium hybrids can infect humans, and have been reported in West African countries, namely Senegal, and during a 2013 outbreak on Corsica."

Both are usually transmitted by the bite of an infected tsetse fly and are most common in rural areas."

Alveolar disease usually begins in the liver but can spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs or brain.
